# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction

Due to huge competition across the insurance market, an auto insurance organisation based in 
the USA is dealing with some barriers in maintaining its customer base and in implementing 
promotional discounts and offers for loyal customers. The organisation is considering CLV value as the 
most important factor for this purpose. Customer Lifetime Value is defined as the worth of a customer 
to a business over time. Companies across the country are not considering only the monthly premium 
as the deciding factor for decisions while implementing strategies. CLV is said to be a customer-focused 
metric to retain valuable and loyal customers and enhance sales from less valuable customers while 
enhancing the general customer experience. CLV also helps the organisation in preventing customer 
churn to plan a budget, measuring performance, etc. The objective here was to predict the CLV 
accurately using supervised regression ML models like linear regression, ridge, and lasso regression 
and perform some visual analytics to determine the perfect model for their problem.
